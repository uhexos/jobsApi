      "description": "<h2>Company Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Hello, we’re OpenPlay!</strong></p>\n<p>We’re looking for a full-stack engineer to work with us on our web-based music distribution application. You’ll work with us to design, develop, and deploy new application features for one of the world’s largest record companies. This is a full-time position that can be local (Los Angeles) or fully remote.</p>\n<h2>What’s an OpenPlay?</h2>\n<p>We’re a small software team making distribution and workflow products for some of the world’s largest music companies. We’re big on testing, constant incremental improvement, craftsmanship, and pragmatism, and so far have been able to use those buzzwords to quickly deliver lots of features to keep the music industry running. We strive to make well engineered software that looks great and is friendly to use. We’re collaborative, supportive, enjoy learning, and most of all enthusiastic about building new things and making old things better.</p>\n<h2>Job Description</h2>\n<p><strong>What you’ll be doing:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Refining requirements.</strong> We follow an agile process focused on rapid incremental delivery. You’ll take rough features born from an interesting idea, a customer request, or an overdue refactor (or a bug), and collaborate designing the user experience and technical direction necessary to release the next (or first) version.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Programming.</strong> It wouldn’t be an engineering position without some programming. We try to get to this step with minimal planning time so we can see how an idea takes shape in the real world. Our languages of choice are Ruby and Javascript. We tend to practice outside-in development: most features start with a rough end-to-end (or system, or integration, etc.) test, then we attach some UI, give it an endpoint to communicate with, and finally add in the persistence layer. You’ll be responsible for your feature iterations from start to finish, but you’ll have a team to help and design support for visual polish.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deploying.</strong> We offload and automate devops as much as possible, but a small part of every feature is still getting it deployed and ensuring it’s working as expected. We deploy features to production a few times per day on a typical day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Skills we’re looking for:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Practical experience in full stack web application development.</strong> At least a few years working on both the server and client side of production web applications. Experience with any client/server development (i.e. mobile) would probably also be pretty applicable. Console game development sounds really cool but probably wouldn’t transfer over as well. TI-86 calculator programming experience wouldn’t be a great fit either.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Academic knowledge of software development.</strong> In addition to being able to make something work, you’ll need to be able to research and articulate why it’s a particularly good solution. A computer science degree is one good barometer we’re looking for, but we understand it’s not the only path to understanding engineering principles and isn't required.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A desire to collaborate with others.</strong> As a team we often discuss new and better ways to approach problems. We do code reviews and we write comments explaining our rationale when code looks smelly. If you enjoy thinking about new solutions to old problems, and can balance that with small, iterative, deliveries, you’ll probably enjoy working with us.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Qualifications</h2>\n<p>Key technology experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Ruby.</strong> Experience with ruby would be ideal, but experience with other object-oriented dynamic languages would transfer over pretty well, especially python (you won’t be the only convert). Extensive experience in any programming language might fit as well. If you’re new to Ruby but enjoy object-oriented programming you’ll probably love it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Javascript.</strong> Experience with other semi-prototypal web-browser-based scripting languages with a nonsense hodge-podge standard library would probably transfer over too, but happily for the world we’re not sure any exist. In any case, the more experience you have with Javascript the better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing.</strong> The heart of our workflow is a full suite of end-to-end tests that we rely on to rapidly and safely build and deploy new features and refactor old code. Prior experience with test driven development or behavior driven development would be a big plus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>More specific technologies we use:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our server-side code is MVC-structured and built around Sequel (ORM) and Sinatra.

We build services, munch data and process real-time information in all things transit - and we’re looking for a backend engineer in the Berlin office to\njoin us in our effort to provide great public transit APIs as one of the pillars for moovel’s rapidly expanding mobility platform.</p>\n<p>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 250 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p>\n<p>HOW THE ROLE WORKS\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.</p>\n<p>With us you’ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools\nof their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it). On the Frontend (IOS, Android and Web) we adopted and embraced Technologies like Swift, Kotlin, Rx or React.</p>\n<p>Breaking down concrete tasks for this position is not that easy, but that's what makes it so exciting. Here are some things we want to entrust you right away:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You write, monitor, scale and architect microservices that comprise our transit backend</li>\n<li>You build infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our data stores</li>\n<li>You develop services using Node.js &amp; Python</li>\n<li>You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions</li>\n<li>You write processing pipelines in Python</li>\n<li>Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ABOUT YOU\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.</p>\n<p>You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies. </p>\n<p>As it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.</p>\n<p>BENEFITS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose your own hardware</li>\n<li>Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices</li>\n<li>Company pension plan</li>\n<li>Free breakfast, coffee &amp; water</li>\n<li>Mobility allowance</li>\n<li>Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts</li>\n<li>Working on products with a high impact on society</li>\n<li>International teams</li>\n<li>Child care allowance</li>\n<li>Flexible working hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds good?\nWe are more than happy to meet you soon!
